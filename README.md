# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview and Purpose of Project
    
        The intent of this study was to see give future fundraisers an outlook on when and how much a kickstarter campaign would be effective
    at beginning. What follows is a summary of the outcomes of Kickstarter campaigns within a set group of categories relevant to our needs. 
    Specifically for the amount of campaigns focused on Theater based fundrasiers, and their success rates based on funding needs.
    What we can see is a clear outline of trends showing that when the Kickstarter was opened has a direct effect on its ability to raise the
    requested amount of capital, while also analyzing how the total amount of the requested funds affected completion.


## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

        The data suggests several trends based on kickoff date. The first suggestion is that overall the success to failure ratio of Theater Kickstarter
    campaigns is quite positive. The amount of failed campaigns trends upward with the amount of total campaigns but successful campaigns greatly spike
    in similar conditions. The total amount of campaigns however seems to be influenced greatly on the time of year they are introduced.
        There is a clear influence during the summer months for Theater Kickstarter campaigns. Winter months show a large decrease in both failed and
    successful campaigns. This suggests that the best time to open a Kickstarter campaign would be be May and while it decreases each month, successful
    campaign numbers remain quite high through August. At the end of the summer failed campaigns increase to meet the amount of successful ones. This
    suggests that the campaigns that start too late run out of backers by around September and October. Things even out by December and the early months
    of the year.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

        The overall outcome of a campaign was heavily weighted by the amount of money requested, usually quite negatively. With the exceptions of those campaigns
    requesting between $35,000 and $44,999, there was a steady decline in goal completion as Amount requested rose. This is misleading as the vast majority of 
    Kickstarter requests in our demographic were requesting less than $9,999. Most of the campaigns below that follow over a 75% success rate. Based on the amount
    needed it is a valid conclusion that requesting a funding amount of less than $10,000 would provide the highest chance of success.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
        The large limitation with this configuration of data is within the success rates on the graph are not weighted. The aforementioned high success rates of the
    campaigns requesting between $35,00 and $44,999 are high but there were only 20 total Kickstarters at those ranges compared to the 889 total campaigns less than $10,000.
        Another less easy misinterpretation of this data is seeing the number of failed campaigns stay relatively consistent while the successful campaigns fluctuate. This
    mislead is also an effect of not taking the total number of requested campaigns into account. With the exception fo the spike in May, June, and July, and the cool down in
    December, the number of successful campaigns remains in a consistent range throughout the year. Which would suggest the time of year plays more of a factor in the total
    number of campaigns rather than the total number of successful or failed campaigns.

## Results

        It would go to suggest that the amount of funding is the greatest factor in the success of a Kickstarter campaign. While the time of year can affect the outcome it does
    not influence it with the exception of one or two moths of the year, in which the total amount of campaigns also increase/decrease. The overall outline of the data suggests
    that the total number of campaigns is the driving force for when campaigns are successful. 
        Based on those criteria it is best to conclude that if we are to begin a Kickstarter campaign with a funding goal of less than $10,000 and time the launch date for early
    summer, the odds of the campaign meeting its desired goal are at their highest. The total number of campaigns is at its peak at that time which led to more success and by
    requesting funding below $10,000 would follow the trend great majority of campaigns doing the same and finding success.


        As a further study, one could compare the total number of campaigns within the Theater category in regards to their funding goals. While we are intending to look at plays,
    since we ourselves were looking for plays, the plays are only a portion of the total number of Kickstarters within the Theater category, and our study did not narrow down the
    the Launch date by the same parameters. Having a clear look at the requested funding amounts of the plays subcategory could also help us determine a more appropriate funding
    goal for ourselves.
