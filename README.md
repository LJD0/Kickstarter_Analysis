# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview and Purpose of Project

The purpose of this study was to provide guidance for future fundraisers who plan to launch a Kickstarter campaign, specifically in the theater category. The study aimed to identify the optimal launch date and funding goal for a campaign to maximize the chances of success.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The data analysis revealed that the time of year has a significant impact on the success rate of theater campaigns. The summer months, especially May, showed the highest success rates, while winter months had a significant decrease in both successful and failed campaigns. The number of campaigns also plays a critical role in the success rate. More campaigns led to more failed and successful campaigns. It's worth noting that campaigns launched too late, around September or October, ran out of backers, resulting in a decline in success rates. December and the early months of the year showed a return to consistent success rates.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The funding goal requested by a campaign also plays a crucial role in its success rate. While campaigns requesting less than $10,000 had a high success rate, campaigns requesting more than $35,000 showed a lower success rate. The data suggest that it's best to request less than $10,000 for the highest chance of success.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

One limitation of this study is that the success rates on the graph are not weighted. The high success rates of campaigns requesting between $35,000 and $44,999 might be misleading since there were only 20 total Kickstarters in that range compared to the 889 total campaigns requesting less than $10,000. Additionally, the number of failed campaigns appears to remain relatively consistent, while the number of successful campaigns fluctuates. However, this is due to the total number of requested campaigns not being taken into account.

## Results

The study's results suggest that the funding goal is the most significant factor affecting a campaign's success rate. Timing the launch date for early summer, when the total number of campaigns is at its peak, increases the odds of success. Based on the data, it's best to request less than $10,000 for the highest chance of success.

As a further study, analyzing the total number of campaigns within the theater category based on their funding goals could help determine a more appropriate funding goal for a campaign.
