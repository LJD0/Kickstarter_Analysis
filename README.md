## Analysis Overview

Through my analysis, I aimed to provide valuable insights for individuals or organizations planning to launch a Kickstarter campaign in the Performing Arts, specifically raising money for a play. The study focused on determining the most effective launch date and funding goal to optimize the chances of a successful campaign.

### Theater Outcomes

Looking at the overall outcomes of the Theater campaigns is hopeful. The number of successful campaigns is almost double the number of failed campaigns, and the canceled campaigns are extremely low as well.

Even when looking at a more narrowed view, this conclusion remains consistent across both charts. The likelihood of success for theater based kickstarter camapigns is looking good.

### Analysis of Launch Date

The large spike in the of the year is

Based on the data, we find that the months of June, July, and August show a significant increase in successful theater campaigns on Kickstarter. May also had a small increase in successful campaigns, which could be attributed to the overall increase in the number of campaigns during that time. 
The number of failed campaigns stayed relatively consistent throughout the year, while the number of canceled campaigns showed little variation. It's worth noting that campaigns launched in September and October experienced a decline in success rates, potentially due to a lack of backers. However, success rates returned to a consistent level in December and the early months of the year.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

As the goal amount increases the percentage of failed campaigns also increases, likewise the percentage of succesful campaigns decreases. One factor in this could be that there are roughly 900 campaigns below $10,000, and only near 20 in the $35,000 to $45,000 range.
Uncharacteristically there is a change in the pattern between Theater Kickstarter Goals between $35,000 and $45,000; the percentage of succesful campaigns spikes. The campaigns could have been timed during the spike in successful campaigns we see in June, July, and August. While there is a high percentage of successful campaigns, there is a low number of total campaigns in that range.

### Results

Overall, the analysis suggests that the most significant factor affecting a campaign's success rate on Kickstarter is the funding goal. It is best to request less than $10,000 for the highest chance of success. Timing the launch date for early summer, specifically in the months of June, July, and August, when the total number of campaigns is at its peak, also increases the odds of success. Although campaigns launched in September and October experience a decline in success rates, potentially due to a lack of backers, success rates return to a consistent level in December and the early months of the year. Further analysis of the total number of campaigns within the theater category based on their funding goals could help determine a more appropriate funding goal for a campaign.
